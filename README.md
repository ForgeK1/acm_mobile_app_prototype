# 📱 ACM Mobile App 📱
🔔 What is ACM Mobile App about? 🔔: The Innovation Committee and I have created a prototype Android mobile application for the ACM CSULA organization which serves to remind the ACM community of upcoming events and easier methods to contact leaders.

📅 What does the app contain? 📅: Using Android Studio and Java, our team was able to create a home page, a calendar section to view and create new events, and a contact page to visit ACM’s social platforms.

ℹ️ Is the app still in production? ℹ️: We started creating the prototype near the end of Fall 2023, and the app has not yet been released to the public since it is still in progress. However, I have handed off the project to a new Innovation Committee lead and they will be working with their team throughout Fall 2023 as we will switch from the Android platform to Flutter to make our app cross-platform before its release in Spring 2023!
