# ACM Mobile App 📱
What is the ACM Mobile App about? 🔔: The Innovation Committee and I have created a prototype Android mobile application for the ACM CSULA organization that reminds the ACM community of upcoming events and easier ways to contact leaders.

What does the app contain? 📅: Using Android Studio and Java, our team created a home page, a calendar section to view and create new events, and a contact page to visit ACM’s social platforms.

Is the app still in production? ℹ️: After our team created this wonderful prototype, I handed off the project to a new Innovation Committee lead who has been working his committee throughout Fall 2023 - 2024 from the Android platform to Flutter to make our app cross-platform!
