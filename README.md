# 📱 ACM Mobile App 📱
🔔 What is ACM Mobile App about? 🔔: A prototype android mobile application started by the Innovation Committee in ACM CSULA organization which serves to remind the ACM community for upcoming events and easier methods to contact leaders.

📅 What does the app contain? 📅: Using Android Studio and Java, our team was able to create a home page, a calendar section to view and create new events, and a contact page to visit ACM’s social platforms.

ℹ️ Is the app still in production? ℹ️: We started creating the app near end of Fall 2023, and the app has not yet been released to the public since it is still in progress. However, we will soon switch from android platform to Flutter in Fall 2023 to make the our app cross platform before its release!
